## Artificial Intelligence (CM3020)

This module is focused on Artificial Intelligence techniques. You
will understand the historical development of Artificial Intelligence
including search, vision and planning. You will become familiar with
the foundations of agent-based approaches to software design, decision
making and problem solving including under uncertainty. You will have an
opportunity to apply Artificial Intelligence techniques to particular
problems such as game playing and decision making.
