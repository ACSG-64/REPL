## Web Development

This module equips you with the skills to design and implement dynamic web applications using foundational web programming concepts and frameworks. The course considers practical skills such as responsive design with CSS as well as the abstract underpinnings of markup languages. The course extends beyond general web programming and into areas of professional practice. These include accessibility standards and ethical, security, and sustainability aspects of web development. The course also considers team working scenarios; you will learn about how teams carry out the full process of developing a web site from assigning roles, through requirements gathering, onto testing and then deployment. The course culminates with an exploration of the exciting intersection of Generative AI and web development, preparing you for the future of the industry.

#### Text editor

If you followed our guide at the [ITP1 resource page](../cm-1005-introduction-to-programming-i/README.md#text-editor), then you already have Visual Studio Code set up. For this course, you may want to install the following extensions in addition to those recommended earlier:

- [IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zignd.html-css-class-completion).
- [stylelint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stylelint.vscode-stylelint) - checks for "code lint" in CSS. Requires [stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) to be installed, as well as a configuration of your choosing (for more information on installing and configuring stylelint, see the [stylelint Docs](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/get-started)).
- [Web Accessibility](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MaxvanderSchee.web-accessibility) - recommends ways for improving the accessibility of web pages. This isn't an "accessibility silver bullet", but it's a start.
